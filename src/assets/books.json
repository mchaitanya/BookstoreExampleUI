            "Better documentation then the kubernetes.io one. I bought this book with the hope that Getting started means instructions and help to install Kubernetes. No, the author uses ready made cloud providers, where Kubernetes is already installed. Too bad that I didn't see this in the preview of this book. Hope you know it through this comment.",
            "It is fine, given the limited alternatives out there, but it reads as if the author gathered together a lot of material and examples and put them into the book without enough attention to providing conceptual background. To a large extent, the approach reads like: type these commands and you'll get it. The book is slightly dated now, since the software is changing. This makes the demo-first method more of an issue than it otherwise would be."

            "Great starter book on the concept. High level selection of topics, conversational presentation, and most importantly a fast read.",
            "For anyone completely new to the idea of random forests, I would highly recommend this book. It goes into sufficient mathematical detail about the different facets of the algorithm without getting lost in those details. I feel this was a wonderful introduction to random forests for me."

Those two algorithms are commonly used in a variety of applications including big data analysis for industry and data analysis competitions like you would find on Kaggle. This book explains how Decision Trees work and how they can be combined into a Random Forest to reduce many of the common problems with decision trees, such as overfitting the training data.",

            "This is a great book for software engineers who want to know more about machine learning. I took the machine learning class on Coursera which was a great introduction in matlab to ML. I was looking for something with more details that covers all different algorithms. This book is exactly that. My python knowledge is also just basic and I haven't struggled at all.",
            "I bought the kindle version and just now purchased the paperback as well. Very well written and the examples are very clear and concise. Make sure to check out the Gitlab repo too. One of the best books I've read in a long time."
