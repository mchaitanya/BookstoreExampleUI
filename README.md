# BookstoreExample

This project is meant to be a sample frontend for this [Spring Microservices](https://github.com/rmalired/springmicroservices) project. At present, it makes no calls to the backend; it runs off mock data hardcoded into the *BooksService*.

## Getting the code

```
git clone git@github.com:mchaitanya/BookstoreExampleUI.git
```

## Installing the dependencies

`cd` into the project directory. Then run: `npm install`

This will download and install all the dependencies for this project (listed in *package.json*).

## Running the development server

Run `npm start` for the live dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

**Note:**
`npm start` is an alias for the Angular CLI command `ng serve`. To learn about the many facilities that the CLI provides, check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
