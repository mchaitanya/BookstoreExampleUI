Another competing option is Facebook's React. Here's a balanced comparison of the two frameworks. \nTo get started with Angular, check out this 50-min YouTube talk by Yakov Fain:\nAngular 4 for Java Developers (Youtube)\nAlso check out this article for an overview of Angular, geared more towards front-end developers: Juri Strumpflohner - Angular 2+: A Getting Started Guide. Make sure to also watch the coding screencast at the end of the article.\nOther Resources\nAngular has been evolving at a very fast rate and may yet take a while to settle down into a stable framework. The official docs/API reference can always be counted on to have the most up-to-date information. Consult them first if something doesn't work.\n\nOfficial Angular Documentation\nOfficial Angular Cheatsheet\nRangle's Angular Training Book\nNg-Conf Youtube Channel - Talks/sessions from the Ng-Conf Angular conference\nAngular Connect Youtube Channel - Talks/sessions from Europe's Angular-Connect conference\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/angular/Components.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/angular/Components.html","title":"additional-page - Components","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponents\nComponents are the main building blocks of an Angular app. The main component file is a TypeScript file marked with the @Component{...} decorator.\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/Bootstrap.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/Bootstrap.html","title":"additional-page - Bootstrap","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBootstrap\nBootstrap is an HTML, CSS, and JS framework to create responsive, mobile-first websites.\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/TypeScript.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/TypeScript.html","title":"additional-page - TypeScript","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypeScript\nintro to typescript\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/Tooling.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/Tooling.html","title":"additional-page - Tooling","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTooling\nVSCode\nEclipse Plugins\nEmmet\nAngular CLI\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/Web_Development.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/Web_Development.html","title":"additional-page - Web_Development","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeb Development\nweb development resources\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"}}
